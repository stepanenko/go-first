# Go (Golang) Notes

Go is a statically typed, compiled, open source programming language designed by Google.

Compiled - code is compiled ahead of execution.

Statically typed - value types are defined in advance.

Go is especially popular for building scalable web servers but also great for automation scripts and command-line programs.
Not good at games and desktop apps.

Go tries to combine the best of C++, Java and Python.
